# Updating existing Installation of Fail2Ban-Report

> Allready collected Daily Fail2Ban -Event Data (up from V 0.1.0) is fully compatible to V 0.5.0

> Blocklists (up from 0.3.3 in *.blocklist.json format) are fully compatible with V 0.5.0

## Get archive/ to the new Structure

right now in your archive/ folder you can find all sorts of .json files

you will have to create a Folder inside of archive/ for your local Installation. This Folder is the "Name" of your Local Server. So if you create a Folder named "Webserver" your local Server will show up in UI as "Webserver"

in your new folder `archive/<SERVERNAME>/` you will have to create 2 additional Folders:

- fail2ban
- blocklists

Change permissions of the new Created Folders and hand it over to your Webserver-User. (chown)

Moove all Daily Event-Lists to `archive/<SERVERNAME>/fail2ban/`
Moove all Blocklists to `archive/<SERVERNAME>/blocklists/`

Your archive/ is set and ready for V 0.5.0
