# Manual Client Installation – Fail2Ban-Report v0.5.0

## Preparation

- Check Fail2Ban → must be running  
- Check UFW → must be running

## Install required packages

```
apt update -qq && apt install jq gawk curl -y -qq
```

```
/opt/Fail2Ban-Report/
    Backend/
    Helper-Scripts/
    archive/
        fail2ban/
        blocklists/
```

## Backend scripts

In /opt/Fail2Ban-Report/Backend/ create the following scripts:

- fail2ban_log2json.sh ← insert client login credentials
- download-checker.sh ← insert client login credentials
- firewall-update.sh ← insert client login credentials
- syncback.sh ← insert client login credentials

Make all .sh files executable:

```
chmod +x /opt/Fail2Ban-Report/Backend/*.sh
```

## Helper scripts

in `/opt/Fail2Ban-Report/Helper-Scripts/` create:

- `create-client-uuid.sh`

Make it executable:
```
chmod +x /opt/Fail2Ban-Report/Helper-Scripts/create-client-uuid.sh
```

Run it once to generate client-uuid.json inside
/opt/Fail2Ban-Report/Settings/

The client UUID will be displayed – copy it.


Optional: Cron jobs
