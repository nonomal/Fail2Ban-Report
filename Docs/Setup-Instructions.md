# 🔧 Fail2Ban-Report Beta 2 – Manual Setup Instructions

These instructions explain how to manually install and configure **Fail2Ban-Report v2** on a Linux system.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- A Linux system (tested with debian only) with the following installed:
  - `fail2ban`
  - `jq`
  - `awk` (gawk)
  - `curl`
  - `ufw` (only UFW is supported at this time)
- A PHP-enabled web server (e.g. Apache with PHP 7.4+)
- The web server user (e.g. `www-data`) must have write access to the `/archive/` directory

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Place the project in your desired web directory, for example:

    /var/www/html/Fail2Ban-Report/

The structure should look like this:

    Fail2Ban-Report/
    ├── assets/
    │   ├── css/style.css
    │   ├── images/*.png
    │   └── js/*.js
    ├── includes/
    │   ├── actions/*.php
    │   ├── block-ip.php
    │   ├── unblock-ip.php
    │   ├── list-files.php
    │   └── footer.php
    ├── archive/    ← must be writable by web server
    │   ├── Client-Servername
    │      ├── fail2ban/
    │      ├── blocklists
    │      └── ufw
    ├── index.php
    ├── .htaccess
    ├── endpoint/
    │   ├── index.php
    │   ├── update.php
    │   ├── download.php
    │   ├── backsync.php
    │   └── .htaccess
    ├── s
    └── (Shell scripts stored outside the web root)

---

## 🔐 Permissions

Make the `/archive/` directory writable for the web server:

    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/Fail2Ban-Report/
    find /var/www/html/Fail2Ban-Report/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
    find /var/www/html/Fail2Ban-Report/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

---

## ⚙️ Shell Scripts

The following two shell scripts **must not** be placed inside the web root.
Recommended path: `/opt/Fail2Ban-Report/`

- `fail2ban_log2json.sh`
- `firewall-update.sh`

Adjust paths in these scripts if necessary:
- `fail2ban_log2json.sh` reads the Fail2Ban log and writes JSON files to `/archive/` (archive/ is a folder placed in the Webspace of /Fail2Ban-Report/ 
- `firewall-update.sh` reads `blocklist.json` and syncs it with UFW (blocks/unblocks) so it also needs the path to `/archive/`

> Make sure both scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)

---

## 🕒 Cronjob Configuration

Set up two cronjobs:

1. Convert logs to JSON every 5–15 minutes:
    
    */5 * * * * root /opt/Fail2Ban-Report/fail2ban_log2json.sh

2. Sync firewall blocklist with UFW every 5–15 minutes:

    */5 * * * * root /opt/Fail2Ban-Report/firewall-update.sh

> Make sure both scripts are executable (`chmod +x`)

---

## 🌐 Web Interface Configuration

- No PHP configuration is required.
- All scripts in `includes/` and `includes/actions/` work without manual changes.
- The web interface displays log information and lets you:
  - View ban history
  - Block/unblock IPs manually
  - Manage the `blocklist.json` interactively

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

The `.htaccess` file includes:

- Protection against direct access to:
  - `.json`, `.sh`, `.ini`, `.log`, `.bak`, `.OLD`
- Rewrite rules for `archive/*.json` and `includes/*.php`
- Strong HTTPS headers
- (Optional) examples for basic authentication and IP restrictions (commented)

Make sure your Apache server honors `.htaccess`, and you enable `mod_rewrite`.

---

## ✅ Setup Complete

You can now access the tool at:

    http(s)://yourdomain.tld/Fail2Ban-Report/

Monitor your logs, manage bans, and secure your system visually and efficiently.

## 🌐 Optional: AbuseIPDB Integration

Fail2Ban-Report supports an optional IP reputation check and reporting via [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/), a public threat intelligence platform.

### 🔎 What It Does

- Displays how often an IP has been reported on AbuseIPDB
- Allows you to manually report abusive IPs directly from the interface
- Helps assess the trustworthiness of IP addresses before unblocking them

### 🧰 Requirements

- A free account at [AbuseIPDB.com](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)
- A personal API key (available in your [AbuseIPDB dashboard](https://www.abuseipdb.com/account/api))

### 🛠 Configuration

1. Create a config file **outside the web root**, e.g. at:

    ```
    /opt/Fail2Ban-Report/fail2ban-report.config
    ```

2. Add the following content (replace the API key placeholder):

    ```ini
    [reports]
    report=true
    report_types=abuseipdb

    [AbuseIPDB API Key]
    abuseipdb_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

3. Ensure the config file is **readable** by the web server (e.g. `www-data`):

    ```bash
    chown www-data:www-data /opt/Fail2Ban-Report/fail2ban-report.config
    chmod 640 /opt/Fail2Ban-Report/fail2ban-report.config
    ```

4. Done — if the file exists and is valid, the web interface will show AbuseIPDB info and allow reporting.

### ⚠️ Custom Path or Filename

If you choose a different location or name for the config file:

- Open this file:

    ```
    includes/actions/reports/abuseipdb.php
    ```

- Look for the line that defines the path:

    ```php
    $configPath = '/opt/Fail2Ban-Report/fail2ban-report.config';
    ```

- Adjust it to match your actual file path.

> ⚠️ The config file must be placed **outside** the web root for security reasons.

### 💡 Notes

- The feature is **fully optional** — Fail2Ban-Report works fine without it.
- AbuseIPDB requests are made **server-side**, your API key is not exposed in the browser.
- Their free tier currently allows **1,000 requests per day**
