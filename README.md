# Fail2Ban-Report
![Fail2Ban-Report Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fail2Ban--Report%20-_🕵️_V0.5.0_(Beta_5)-gold?style=flat&logoColor=black)


> A lightweight web-based multi-server dashboard that transforms daily Fail2Ban logs into searchable and filterable JSON reports, while also providing centralized UFW IP blocklist management across all your servers through a pull-based client-side synchronization via secure HTTPS endpoints.


**Integration**
>Designed for easy integration on a wide range of Linux systems — from small Raspberry Pis to modest business setups — though it’s not (yet) targeted at large-scale enterprise environments.
High flexibility comes from the backend shell scripts, which you can adapt to your specific environment or log sources to provide the JSON data the web interface needs (daily JSON event files).


## 🛡️ **Note**: This tool is a visualization and management layer — it does **not** replace proper intrusion detection or access control. Deploy it behind IP restrictions or HTTP authentication only!

## ⚠️ Status of the Project

**Current Status:**  
> Fail2Ban-Report currently manages bans and unbans via UFW, providing a safe and persistent solution.
It does not modify Fail2Ban jails or existing Fail2Ban configurations directly, instead using UFW for its own "permanent jails".

> **Version 0.5.0 introduces multi-server support and role-based access:** Viewer accounts are read-only, while Admins can manage bans/unbans and blocklists across all connected servers via the dashboard.

**Future Direction:**  
> A potential long-term enhancement could include **direct interaction with Fail2Ban jails** — for example, user-controlled bans and unbans per jail.  
The existing structured `*.blocklist.json` format is already designed to support this, ensuring that any future manual ban management can remain "persistent", reviewable, and fully auditable.

**Syncronisation-Concept and Chain of Trust**
> you can read about the Syncronisation Concept in this Document [Sync-Concept](Docs/Sync-Concept.md) to get a better understanding of how it works

> you can read about the "Chain of Trust" between Server and Clients in this Document: [Chain of Trust](Docs/chain-of-trust.md)

Critical backend operations (like UFW updates) are executed via root cron scripts; ensure the server running Fail2Ban-Report is fully secured.

## 📚 What It Does

Fail2Ban-Report parses your `fail2ban.log` and generates JSON-based reports viewable via a responsive web dashboard.  
It provides optional tools to:

- 📊 View **ban/unban events** and per-jail statistics
- 🌐 Switch between multiple servers in a single dashboard
- 🔐 Use authentication with **viewer** (read-only) and **admin** (block/unblock) roles
- 📂 Maintain **persistent blocklists** (per jail and per server) with metadata (`active`, `pending`, `source`)
  - no fire & forget
- ⚡ Apply or remove firewall rules (currently via **ufw**)
- 🚨 Get configureable warnings for unusual activity (DDoS, brute-force, scans)
- 🚨 Mark IPs with 🔴 repeat bans or 🟡 ban increases
- 🔍 Optional integrations: (_Free API-KEYS_)
  - [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) for reputation lookups
  - [IP-Info.io](https://ipinfo.io/) for region/provider checks

> **Note:** Viewer accounts are read-only. Direct integration with other firewalls or native Fail2Ban jail commands is not yet implemented.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

**Backend (Shell scripts):**
- Parse Fail2Ban logs → generate daily JSON event files
- Maintain and update jail-specific blocklists (`*.blocklist.json`)
- Sync blocklists with `ufw`
- Provide HTTPS endpoint for multi-server synchronization

**Frontend (PHP Web Interface):**
- Event timeline with filtering and search
- Per-jail blocklist view
- Multi-server dropdown
- Bulk actions (ban/unban/report)
- Pending status for actions not yet applied
- Warning/critical indicators for activity spikes
- Authentication: viewer (read-only) / admin (ban/unban)

**Blocklists (JSON):**
- Stored per jail and per server
- Include metadata: jail, status, timestamps, source
- Modified only by authenticated admins

## ⚡ Performance & Stress Test

Fail2Ban-Report has been tested under high-load conditions to verify stability, responsiveness, and reliable synchronization across multiple servers.

**Real Scenario:**

- **Duration: ~10 minutes**
- **Webserver events:** ~13,400 entries across several jails (mostly SSH)
- **Data per event:** date, action, marker, IP, jail

**Key Results:**

- Since each ban is triggered after 4 failed attempts, the actual number of incoming requests corresponds to roughly 53,600 login attempts over 10 minutes → about 5,360 requests per minute (≈ 89 requests per second).
- The WebUI loads all 13,480 daily JSON entries in about 1.5 seconds.
- Connected clients consistently pulled and pushed blocklists without any delay. Even when a blocklist update included 80+ new IP entries, the synchronization completed in a blink of an eye, with changes applied in both directions instantly.
- Switching between multiple servers in the dashboard remains smooth, typically under 2 seconds, even during attacks.

**Takeaway:**

Fail2Ban-Report maintains fast performance and reliable data synchronization, proving its suitability for multi-server setups and high-frequency event environments.

## 🛣️ Roadmap or "Things I will have to do - but I do them later"

> I gave up the usual Roadmap - to have more freedom with development - Things like Multiserver was never on the Roadmap but allways in my mind.

- ⏳ Rework Blocklist Overlay
- ⏳ Rework Stylesheet
- ⏳ Rework Info Notices

> As I am using Fail2Ban-Report I think it has a lot of potential to become something nice for not just myself.

> Suggestions and Ideas still welcome at any time (see Discussions) - When you are using Fail2Ban-Report and you think "I would need to see .. " tell me, I am happy to see your Ideas!

## ✅ What It Is
- A **role-based web dashboard** for Fail2Ban events: read-only for Viewers, action-enabled for Admins  
- A tool to **visualize** bans/unbans and **manually** manage blocked IPs  
- A **log parser + JSON generator** that works alongside your existing Fail2Ban setup  
- A way to **sync a persistent, per-jail blocklist** with your firewall (currently **UFW only**)  
- Supports **multi-server setups**, allowing you to switch between servers in the dashboard  
- Designed for **sysadmins** who want quick insights without SSH-ing into the server  

## ❌ What It Is Not
- ❌ A replacement for **Fail2Ban** itself (it depends on Fail2Ban)  
- ❌ A real-time IDS/IPS (data updates depend on log parsing intervals)  
- ❌ A universal firewall manager (no native support for iptables/nftables, etc. — yet)  
- ❌ A tool for **automatic** jail management (manual actions only for now)  
- ❌ A heavy analytics platform — it’s lightweight and log-driven by design
- ❌ A Playground for inexperienced People trying to block half of the Internet
