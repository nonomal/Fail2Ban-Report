# Fail2Ban-Report
> Beta 5.0 | Version 0.5.0

> A lightweight web-based multi-server dashboard that transforms daily Fail2Ban logs into searchable and filterable JSON reports, while also providing centralized UFW IP blocklist management across all your servers.

**Integration**
>Designed for easy integration on a wide range of Linux systems — from small Raspberry Pis to modest business setups — though it’s not (yet?) targeted at large-scale enterprise environments.
High flexibility comes from the backend shell scripts, which you can adapt to your specific environment or log sources to provide the JSON data the web interface needs (daily JSON event files).


## 🛡️ **Note**: This tool is a visualization and management layer — it does **not** replace proper intrusion detection or access control. Deploy it behind IP restrictions or HTTP authentication only!

🔐 Security Notice

**Current Status:**  
> Fail2Ban-Report currently manages bans and unbans via UFW, providing a safe and persistent solution.
It does not modify Fail2Ban jails or existing Fail2Ban configurations directly, instead using UFW for its own "permanent jails".

> Version 0.5.0 introduces multi-server support and role-based access: Viewer accounts are read-only, while Admins can manage bans/unbans and blocklists across all connected servers via the dashboard.

**Future Direction:**  
> A potential long-term enhancement could include **direct interaction with Fail2Ban jails** — for example, user-controlled bans and unbans per jail.  
The existing structured `*.blocklist.json` format is already designed to support this, ensuring that any future manual ban management can remain "persistent", reviewable, and fully auditable.

Please read the [Installation Instructions](Setup-Instructions.md) carefully and secure your deployment with the provided `.htaccess`.
> Have in mind, that you are installing Beta Software that could contain bugs or can change with next release.

> Critical backend operations (like UFW updates) are executed via root cron scripts; ensure the server running Fail2Ban-Report is fully secured.

## 📚 What It Does
Fail2Ban-Report parses your `fail2ban.log` and generates JSON-based reports viewable via a responsive web dashboard.  
It provides optional tools to:  

- 📊 Visualize **ban** and **unban** events, including per-jail statistics  
- ⚡ Interact with IPs (e.g., manually block, unblock) — **only Admins can perform actions**  
- 📂 Maintain **jail-specific and per-server** persistent blocklists (JSON) with `active`, `pending`, and `source` metadata  
- 🔄 Sync those lists with your system firewall using **ufw**  
- 🌐 Switch between multiple servers in the dashboard for multi-server setups  
- 🚨 Show **Warning and Critical indicators** when ban rates exceed configurable thresholds  
- 🚨 Show **Markers** when an IP Address had a **ban-increase** (🟡) or **more than one ban event** on one day (🔴)

> **Note:** Viewer accounts are read-only. Direct integration with other firewalls or native Fail2Ban jail commands is not yet implemented.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **Backend Shell Scripts**:  
  - Parse logs and generate daily JSON event files  
  - Maintain and update `*.blocklist.json` per server  
  - Apply or remove firewall rules based on blocklist entries (`ufw`)  
  - Support for multi-server environments (future: rsync backend)  

- **Frontend Web Interface**:  
  - Displays event timelines, statistics, and per-jail blocklists  
  - Allows **multi-selection** for bulk ban/report actions  
  - Shows **pending status** for unprocessed manual actions  
  - Displays real-time warning indicators  
  - **Server switching**: choose which server’s data to view  
  - **Authentication**: Viewer (read-only) / Admin (Ban/Unban)  

- **JSON Blocklists**:  
  - Stored per jail and per server  
  - Contain IP entries with metadata (`active`, `pending`, timestamps, jail name, source)  
  - Only admins can modify entries (block/unblock)

## 🛣️ Roadmap
> I gave up the usual Roadmap - to have more freedom with development - Things like Multiserver was never on the Roadmap but allways in my mind.
> Using Fail2Ban-Report since it exists i have got some different views in terms of what Fail2Ban-Report is and how I think about what this project can become with a little time and polish.
> Suggestions and Ideas still welcome at any time (see Discussions)
> When you are using Fail2Ban-Report and you think "I would need to see .. " tell me, I am happy to see your Ideas!

## 👀 Outlook
- 📦 Further Improvements & Security Enhancements

There's a simple demo version available here – no backend, no real data:

## ✅ What It Is
- A **role-based web dashboard** for Fail2Ban events: read-only for Viewers, action-enabled for Admins  
- A tool to **visualize** bans/unbans and **manually** manage blocked IPs  
- A **log parser + JSON generator** that works alongside your existing Fail2Ban setup  
- A way to **sync a persistent, per-jail blocklist** with your firewall (currently **UFW only**)  
- Supports **multi-server setups**, allowing you to switch between servers in the dashboard  
- Designed for **sysadmins** who want quick insights without SSH-ing into the server  

## ❌ What It Is Not
- ❌ A replacement for **Fail2Ban** itself (it depends on Fail2Ban)  
- ❌ A real-time IDS/IPS (data updates depend on log parsing intervals)  
- ❌ A universal firewall manager (no native support for iptables/nftables, etc. — yet)  
- ❌ A tool for **automatic** jail management (manual actions only for now)  
- ❌ A heavy analytics platform — it’s lightweight and log-driven by design
