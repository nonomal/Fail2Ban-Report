# Fail2Ban-Report
> Beta 3.4 | Version 0.3.4

> A simple and clean web-based dashboard to turn your daily Fail2Ban logs into searchable and filterable JSON reports — with optional IP blocklist management for UFW.

**Integration**
>Designed for easy integration on a wide range of Linux systems — from small Raspberry Pis to modest business setups — though it’s not (yet) targeted at large-scale enterprise environments.
Flexibility comes from the two backend shell scripts, which you can adapt to your specific environment or log sources to provide the JSON data the web interface needs (daily JSON event files).

🛡️ **Note**: This tool is a visualization and management layer — it does **not** replace proper intrusion detection or access control. Deploy it behind IP restrictions or HTTP authentication.

🔐 Security Notice

**Current Status:**  
> Fail2Ban-Report currently manages bans and unbans through **UFW**, serving as a safe **intermediate solution**.  
It does **not** directly modify Fail2Ban jails or change existing fail2ban configurations.

**Future Direction:**  
> A potential long-term enhancement could include **direct interaction with Fail2Ban jails** — for example, user-controlled bans and unbans per jail.  
The existing structured `*.blocklist.json` format is already designed to support this, ensuring that any future manual ban management can remain "persistent", reviewable, and fully auditable.

Please read the [Installation Instructions](Setup-Instructions.md) carefully and secure your deployment with the provided `.htaccess`.
> still a little experimental feature : Use the Installer ![Installer Setup Documentation](installer-setup.md) It would be great if you tell me if the installer worked for your needs.

## 📚 What It Does
Fail2Ban-Report parses your `fail2ban.log` and generates JSON-based reports viewable via a responsive web dashboard.  
It provides optional tools to:  

- 📊 Visualize **ban** and **unban** events, including per-jail statistics  
- ⚡ Interact with IPs (e.g., manually block, unblock, or report to external services)  
- 📂 Maintain **jail-specific** persistent blocklists (JSON) with `active` and `pending` status  
- 🔄 Sync those lists with your system firewall using **ufw**  
- 🚨 Show **warning indicators** when ban rates exceed configurable thresholds  

> **Note:** Direct integration with other firewalls or native Fail2Ban jail commands is not yet implemented.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview
- **Backend Shell Scripts**:  
  - Parse logs and generate daily JSON event files  
  - Maintain and update `*.blocklist.json`  
  - Apply or remove firewall rules based on blocklist entries (`ufw`)  

- **Frontend Web Interface**:  
  - Displays event timelines, statistics, and per-jail blocklists  
  - Allows **multi-selection** for bulk ban/report actions  
  - Shows **pending status** for unprocessed manual actions  
  - Displays real-time warning indicators  

- **JSON Blocklists**:  
  - Stored per jail  
  - Contain IP entries with metadata (`active`, `pending`, timestamps, jail name)  

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔍 **Searchable + filterable** log reports (date, jail, IP)
- 🔧 **Integrated JSON blocklist** for persistent Block-Overview
- 🧱 **Firewall sync** using UFW (planned: nftables, firewalld)
- ⚡ **Lightweight setup** — no DB, no frameworks
- 🔐 **Compatible with hardened environments** (no external assets, strict headers)
- 🛠️ **Installer script** to automate setup and permissions
- 🧩 **Modular design** for easy extension
- 🪵 Optional logging of block/unblock actions (set true/false and logpath in `firewall-update.sh`)
- 🕵️ **Optional Feature :** IP reputation check via AbuseIPDB (manual lookup from web interface)

> 🧰 Works even on small setups (Raspberry Pi, etc.)

## 🆕 Hot Fix V 0.3.4
Json Files should not loose Data anymore when several write processes trying to write the json file at the same time.

- `firewall-update.sh`: Added FLOCK to lock json when writing
- `block-ip.php`: Added FLOCK to lock json when writing
- `unblock-ip.php`: Added FLOCK to lock json when writing


## 🆕 What's New in V 0.3.3 (QoL Update)
### ⚠️ Warning System and Pending Status Indicators
- 🚨 New [Warnings] section in .config to configure warning & critical thresholds (events per minute per jail) in format warning:critical (e.g: 20:50).
- 👀 warning & critical status indicators (colored dots) in the header for quick overview.
- ⏳ Manual block/unblock actions now mark IPs as pending until processed by firewall-update.
- 📊 Pending entries are now visible in blocklist stats for better tracking.

### ✔️ Multi-Selection UI and Bulk Actions for Ban & Report
- ✅ Switched from per-row action buttons to checkbox multi-selection for IPs.
- 📋 New dedicated “Ban” and “Info” buttons for bulk processing.
- 🔄 Frontend updated to handle and display results for multiple IP actions simultaneously.
- 🔔 New notification system for success/info/error messages on each action.

### 🛠 Backend Improvements & New IP Reporting
- 🔄 Backend now accept arrays of IPs for ban and report actions, with detailed aggregated feedback.
- 🆕 Added IPInfo API integration alongside AbuseIPDB for richer geolocation and network info.
- ⏲️ Built-in delay between report requests to avoid API rate limits.
- ⚙️ Improved error handling and user feedback for multi-IP operations.

### ⚠️ Upgrade Notice

If you're upgrading from an existing installation : pre 0.3.2 and also from 0.3.2

- ⚠️ **The new blocklist format is not compatible with the old `blocklist.json`.** and got new field `pending` is in json since 0.3.3
- 🧹 To ensure a clean transition and avoid orphaned firewall entries, follow these steps:

  1. **Empty your current blocklist** via the **Unblock** buttons in the UI.
  2. 🔄 Trigger a **sync** using the `firewall-update.sh` to remove all Fail2Ban-Report-related rules from the firewall.
  3. 🗑️ Delete the old `blocklist.json`.
  4. 📦 Replace all files with the new version (overwrite).
  5. ✅ Done! The new system will now build jail-specific blocklists automatically.

- 🛠️ _Optional_ : Run the `installer.sh` again to get a fresh setup.

> This ensures no leftover blocks remain in your firewall from the previous system.

## 🖥️ Demo
👀 Want to try out the look & feel?
There's a simple demo version available here – no backend, no real data:
👉 https://suble.net/ 🔗

---

## ✅ What It Is
- A **read-only + action-enabled** web dashboard for Fail2Ban events  
- A tool to **visualize** bans/unbans and **manually** manage blocked IPs  
- A **log parser + JSON generator** that works alongside your existing Fail2Ban setup  
- A way to **sync a persistent blocklist** with your firewall (currently **UFW only**)  
- Designed for **sysadmins** who want quick insights without SSH-ing into the server  

## ❌ What It Is Not
- ❌ A replacement for **Fail2Ban** itself (it depends on Fail2Ban)  
- ❌ A real-time IDS/IPS (data updates depend on log parsing intervals)  
- ❌ A universal firewall manager (no native support for iptables/nftables, etc. — yet)  
- ❌ A tool for **automatic** jail management (manual actions only for now)  
- ❌ A heavy analytics platform — it’s lightweight and log-driven by design
