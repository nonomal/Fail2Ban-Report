# Fail2Ban-Report
> Beta 3.2 | Version 0.3.2

A simple and clean web-based dashboard to turn your daily Fail2Ban logs into searchable and filterable JSON reports — with optional IP blocklist management for UFW.

🛡️ **Note**: This tool is a visualization and management layer — it does **not** replace proper intrusion detection or access control. Deploy it behind IP restrictions or HTTP authentication.

🔐 Security Notice

> **Current Status:**  
Fail2Ban-Report currently manages bans and unbans via **UFW** as a safe **intermediate solution**.  
It does **not yet** directly modify Fail2Ban jails or existing fail2ban configurations.

> **Future Direction:**  
The goal is to support **direct management of Fail2Ban jails** in upcoming versions — including user-controlled bans and unbans per jail.  
To ensure full control and auditability, all manual ban actions are already tracked in a structured `blocklist.json`, which will later serve as the trusted source for persistent and reviewable ban state.
 
Please read the [Installation Instructions](Setup-Instructions.md) carefully and secure your deployment with the provided `.htaccess`.
> still a little experimental feature : Use the Installer ![Installer Setup Documentation](installer-setup.md) It would be great if you tell me if the installer worked for your needs.

## 📚 What It Does
Fail2Ban-Report parses your fail2ban.log and generates JSON-based reports viewable via a web dashboard. It provides optional tools to:

- Visualize ban and unban events
- Interact with IPs (e.g., manually block or unblock)
- Maintain a persistent blocklist.json
- Sync that list with your system firewall using ufw (support for other firewalls or direct communication with Fail2Ban jails is not yet implemented)

## 🧱 Architecture overview:

- Backend Shell Scripts: Parse logs, generate JSON files, and update UFW rules based on blocklist.json
- Frontend Web Interface: Visualizes data and offers action controls
- JSON Blocklist: Stores manually blocked IPs marked with active=true

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔍 **Searchable + filterable** log reports (date, jail, IP)
- 🔧 **Integrated JSON blocklist** for persistent Block-Overview
- 🧱 **Firewall sync** using UFW (planned: nftables, firewalld)
- ⚡ **Lightweight setup** — no DB, no frameworks
- 🔐 **Compatible with hardened environments** (no external assets, strict headers)
- 🛠️ **Installer script** to automate setup and permissions
- 🧩 **Modular design** for easy extension
- 🪵 Optional logging of block/unblock actions (set true/false and logpath in `firewall-update.sh`)
- 🕵️ **Optional Feature :** IP reputation check via AbuseIPDB (manual lookup from web interface)

> 🧰 Works even on small setups (Raspberry Pi, etc.)

## 🆕 What's New in V 0.3.2

### 🧱 New Blocklist Logic
- 🔁 Blocking an IP address now stores it in a **jail-specific blocklist** (`blocklist["jailname"][]`) instead of one global list.
- 🔍 Improves clarity and allows easier tracking of blocked IPs **per jail**.

### 📊 Extended Statistics
- 📅 The Fail2Ban stats panel now includes:
  - ✅ **Today’s** bans & unbans (as before)
  - 🕓 **Yesterday**
  - 📈 **Last 7 Days**
  - 📊 **Last 30 Days**
- 🗂️ Based on your existing daily `fail2ban-events-YYYYMMDD.json` files — no setup needed.

### 🧩 Per-Jail Blocklist Display
- 🧾 Each jail now displays its own **blocklist section** with:
  - 🔒 Active bans
  - ⏳ Pending entries
- 🔄 Auto-refresh every **60 seconds**.
- 🧮 Layout adapts to **varying jail name lengths** — cleaner and more readable UI.

### ⚙️ Performance & UX
- 🚀 Optimized update intervals (**default: 10–60 seconds**).
- 🧘‍♂️ Minimal server and browser load — ideal for low-traffic admin use.

### ⚠️ Upgrade Notice

If you're upgrading from an existing installation:

- ⚠️ **The new blocklist format is not compatible with the old `blocklist.json`.**
- 🧹 To ensure a clean transition and avoid orphaned firewall entries, follow these steps:

  1. **Empty your current blocklist** via the **Unblock** buttons in the UI.
  2. 🔄 Trigger a **sync** using the `firewall-update.sh` to remove all Fail2Ban-Report-related rules from the firewall.
  3. 🗑️ Delete the old `blocklist.json`.
  4. 📦 Replace all files with the new version (overwrite).
  5. ✅ Done! The new system will now build jail-specific blocklists automatically.

- 🛠️ _Optional_ : Run the `installer.sh` again to get a fresh setup.

> This ensures no leftover blocks remain in your firewall from the previous system.
